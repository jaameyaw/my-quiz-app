# my quiz app
A customizable quiz app built with vanilla JavaScript. Users can choose how many questions they want to attempt, and immediate visual feedback is provided after each answer using Font Awesome icons. I built this to sharpen my skills in DOM manipulation, working with arrays, and creating accessible, interactive UIs. Key features include keyboard-accessible controls (e.g., using Enter to start or proceed), dynamic answer checking with real-time UI updates, and prevention of multiple selections per question.
